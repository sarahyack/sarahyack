### WhoAmI

Hello, thanks for checking out my profile! Who am I? Well, I'm an aspiring Indie Game Developer with a taste for machine learning and AI. I have a particular love for Godot as a game engine, and plan to use that as my primary tool in the future, and for all other non-game related projects, I love the Jetbrains IDEs!

Currently, my GitHub requires a bit of an overhaul as I've pivoted most of my priorities, but feel free to browse my repositories!

Thanks for checking in! Have a great day, ðŸ˜‰!
